%%% No boot work of its own: the reckon-db store (`mcl_mail_store`)
%%% and its evoq subscription are opened by `mcl_om:boot/1` before any
%%% app's `start/2` runs (this service exports `store_id/0`+`data_dir/0`
%%% -- see `mcl_mail_service.erl`), and this app's own desks are pure
%%% command/event/handler modules with no processes to start yet.
