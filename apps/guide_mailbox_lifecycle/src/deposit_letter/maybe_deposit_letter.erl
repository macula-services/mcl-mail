%%% @doc Handler for `deposit_letter_v1`.
%%%
%%% Pure: the `mailbox_not_opened'/`mailbox_closed'/`mailbox_archived'
%%% guards live in the aggregate (`mailbox_aggregate:guard_open/2'), not
%%% here. Deposit does NOT auto-open a mailbox on a citizen's behalf --
%%% letting any caller vivify a mailbox for a DID that never opened one
%%% would let a stranger populate a directory entry nobody asked for.
%%%
%%% No de-duplication on `letter_id` here: this is a single-aggregate
%%% write, and checking "does this letter_id already exist" against
%%% current state would make a retried deposit with the same id silently
%%% do nothing, which is a bigger surprise for a genuine second letter
%%% that happens to collide than the deposit_letter_responder generating
%%% a fresh id per call already prevents. If idempotent retry ever
%%% becomes a real need, it belongs at the responder layer, not here.
