%%% @doc Handler for `reply_to_letter_v1`.
%%%
%%% The mailbox-open guard lives in the aggregate
%%% (`mailbox_aggregate:guard_open/2'); the original-letter lookup stays
%%% here. `original_sender_did` comes from the ALREADY-LOADED
%%% aggregate state (the original letter is right there, since it's
%%% stored in THIS mailbox) -- never from caller input, so a replier
%%% cannot misdirect a reply to someone other than who actually sent it.
%%%
%%% `dispatch/1` is genuinely two dispatches, not one: `execute/2`/
%%% `apply/2` only ever touch ONE aggregate's stream (this replier's own
%%% mailbox), so the actual delivery of the reply into the ORIGINAL
%%% SENDER's mailbox is a second, separate dispatch chained here -- the
%%% right layer for it, since `dispatch/1` is the I/O boundary, not the
%%% aggregate's business-rule layer.
